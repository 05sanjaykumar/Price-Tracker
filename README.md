# 🛒 AI-Powered Price Tracker

A full-stack AI-enhanced product tracker that scrapes real-time listings, summarizes them using LLMs (via Groq), and displays results through a clean React frontend.

Built by a solo developer. Powered by real engineering, DevOps, and AI integrations.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔎 **Real-Time Scraping:** Collects product listings from e-commerce sites and custom Bing search using Puppeteer.
- 🤖 **AI Summarization:** Uses **Groq-hosted LLMs** (`LLaMA 4 Scout`, `Mixtral`, etc.) to summarize the best results per user query.
- 🌐 **Full Stack System:**
  - React + Vite frontend
  - Flask backend
  - MongoDB for storing queries
  - LangChain for model abstraction
- 🐳 **Containerized:** Fully Dockerized system via `docker-compose`.

## 🧰 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/05sanjaykumar/Price-Tracker
cd price-tracker-ai
````

### 2. Create `.env.local`

In the `ai-summariser/` folder:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
GROQ_API_BASE=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
MODEL_NAME=meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct
```

> You can optionally remove Ollama support by disabling that service in `docker-compose.yml`.

### 3. Run with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This spins up:

* MongoDB
* Backend (Flask)
* AI summariser service
* Frontend (React)

---

### 🧪 How to Use

Visit the frontend:

```bash
http://localhost:5173
```

You’ll find a simple UI where you can enter a natural language query like:

> 💬 **"Best gaming laptops under ₹1 lakh"**

The system will:

1. Scrape the latest product listings
2. Summarize the best options using LLMs (Groq or local)
3. Return a clear, ranked summary to the user interface
